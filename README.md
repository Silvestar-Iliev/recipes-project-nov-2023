#Recipes Project - November 2023

#Description:

This project is an exam assignment for the ReactJS course at SoftUni in October 2023. As of November 16, 2023, the project is in the development stage, with the final submission deadline set for December 9, 2023. The project is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using React, with custom HTML and CSS. It utilizes the SoftUni educational server as a backend. The application serves as a recipe website where users can create, modify, delete, and read various recipes.

#Installation:

1. Download the project folder and place it in the same directory as the SoftUni educational server folder.
2. Install the required node_modules by running npm i in both the project and server folders.
3. In the project folder, open the terminal and start the project with npm start.
4. In the server folder, open the terminal and start the server with node server.js.

#Usage and Features:

The project features a static home page, a page displaying all created recipes, and a detailed page for each recipe, as well as login and register pages.
After registration or login, users have access to the recipe creation form. Each recipe includes information such as title, description, and nutritional values for 100g of the respective dish (calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat).
Recipe creators (logged-in users) can delete or edit their recipes. Users who did not create the recipe can like it or add it to their favorites.
All logged-in users can leave comments under each recipe.
Each logged-in user has a profile page with information about the user, a list of recipes they've created, and a list of favorite recipes.
Recipes in the favorites list can be removed, and users can calculate the total nutritional values for 100g of the selected recipes.
